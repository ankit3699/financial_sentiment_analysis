# Financial sentiment analysis

Financial sentiment analysis using text feature extraction and text classification techniques. The objective is to classify each document (basically a sentence) of the given corpus into positive, negative or neutral categories.


I have compared models trained on Sentiment analysis for financial datasets using wordnet and without wordnet.
